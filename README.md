# Apache Kafka for Beginners 

Just going through the Udemy Apache Kafka course for beginners and translating the code to Scala. 

This code is not in a great state, I am just using it as a space to learn Kafka.

Twitter API keys are read from these environment variables, ensure they are set up before starting IntelliJ

```
consumer-key = TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
consumer-secret = TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
token = TWITTER_TOKEN
secret = TWITTER_SECRET
```
